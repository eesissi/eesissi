<p><strong>Course Introduction</strong>:</p>
<p>The prerequisite courses for this course include College Computer, Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Statistics, and Programming. It focuses on the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), aiming to systematically impart relevant basic theories and key technologies to students. At the same time, it introduces the current hot topics and practical applications in the AI field.</p>
<p>The course content is rich and diverse, covering but not limited to data space, data types, knowledge representation, knowledge reasoning, reinforcement learning, dimensionality reduction, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, language models, generative AI, and large models. Through the study of this course, students can not only deeply understand the development history and basic concepts of AI, but also firmly master relevant theories and technologies and flexibly apply the learned knowledge in practice.</p>
<p>As an important part of the course, students are required to complete an AI - related application project to test and improve their practical application ability. In 2024, students majoring in Financial Technology (Sino - foreign Cooperative Education) of the class of 2022 performed outstandingly in this course and contributed many excellent course designs. The following are some selected excellent cases.</p>
<h3 id="project-case-1-llama-trump">
  <strong>Project Case 1: LLama Trump</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#project-case-1-llama-trump">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In the course of history, many influential figures have been remembered for their unique personal traits. When it comes to people with a distinctive speaking style, Donald Trump often comes to mind first for many people. His language style is highly recognizable, with concise and powerful expressions and unique word - usage habits, leaving a deep impression on everyone.</p>
<p>Based on the knowledge about large models taught by the teacher in class, the students fine - tuned a large model (LLaMA) to enable it to imitate the language style of US President Donald Trump and have conversations with him.</p>
<p><strong>LLama Trump Experience Website:</strong> :  http://39.107.221.209</p>
<div align=center><img src="/static/images/class1_1.png"  width="672" height="300"  border="0" /></div>
<p>This course design will be continuously improved under the further guidance of the teacher in the later stage, and ultimately achieve multimodal AI.</p>
<p>If you are also interested in such large models or want to train one by yourself, you are welcome to contact us to obtain our project documents:</p>

  Project Case 2: Prediction of Early Stock Price Movements of Listed Companies Based on Fundamental Data
  <a class="anchor" href="#project-case-2-prediction-of-early-stock-price-movements-of-listed-companies-based-on-fundamental-data">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The dataset used in this project is sourced from Wind Data, aiming to accurately predict the price increase or decrease on the first day of a company&rsquo;s listing based on its fundamental situation.</p>
<p>In terms of feature selection, this project carefully selects a series of key features in strict accordance with the laws of the capital market and macro - and micro - economic theories, including the initial offering price, the initial price - to - earnings ratio, the listing board, the rise and fall of the industry index, the initial sponsor, whether the enterprise belongs to the &ldquo;specialized, refined, characteristic, and new&rdquo; category, the net profit value, the trading volume on the first day of listing, and the shareholding ratio of the top ten shareholders. The students use feature engineering techniques and advanced models such as Random Forest and XGBoost to conduct predictive analysis on relevant labels.</p>
<div align=center><img src="/static/images/class1_2.png"  width="672" height="370"  border="0" /></div>
<p>In the later stage of this course design, news features and the level features of major shareholders will be added according to the teacher&rsquo;s suggestions to further improve the accuracy.</p>
